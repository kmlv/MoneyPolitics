        The following experiment is a public goods game in which you and other members of your group will perform effort tasks
        and then be assigned an income either in accordance to your performance on the task or by luck. Therefor some people
        will have lucky income while others have income based on their performance. The players will then have the chance 
        to send messages to others explaining what tax system should be chosen before players vote on their preference for a 
        tax system.
