        This experiment consists of X rounds of interaction. At the beginning of each 
        round, you will be randomly assigned to a group of nine participants. All rounds 
        will have a similar structure and rules: You will first perform a task. Your 
        initial wealth will be determined by your performance in the task or by luck. 
        Then all the participants will choose a tax level that will apply to the whole 
        group. Before choosing the tax level, you may receive the chance to send a message 
        to other participants. We detail the rules below.

        Generating Initial Wealth
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </h5>

    <p>
      In every round, every group member will perform a task. After the task, the 
      computer will generate a ranking of performance in the task for all nine 
      participants. Your position in the ranking might or might not determine your 
      initial wealth following a probabilistic rule.
    </p>

    <p>
      There will be six wealth levels: 9, 15, 25, 40, 80, and 125. If your wealth is 
      generated by your ranking the following table will apply:

  <p>
    Notice there are nine participants, but only six different wealth levels. 
    Two participants, ranks 4 and 5, both have wealth level 25, and three participants, 
    ranks 6, 7 and 8, each have wealth level 15.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your wealth might be determined by performance in the task or by luck, as follows. 
    After rankings are determined, the computer will flip a virtual coin. If it comes 
    up heads, six participants’  will have their initial wealth be determined by their 
    ranking in the task, and the wealth of the other three will be randomly determined 
    by shuffling them from the positions they would have occupied according to the 
    table. If it comes up tails, only three participants’ initial wealth will be 
    determined by their ranking in the task, and the wealth of each of the other six 
    will be determined by random shuffling. That is, with a 50% chance, the majority 
    of the nine participants will have their initial wealth be determined by their 
    performance, and with the remaining 50% chance, the majority of participants’ 
    wealth will be determined by luck. Those whose initial wealth is not determined by 
    their performance are assigned the wealth associated with another member’s 
    performance, by way of random position shuffling.

    {% blocktrans trimmed %}
    Selecting a Tax Rate for the Group
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </h5>

  <p>
    Participants’ initial wealth levels help to determine their earnings in the 
    experiment by serving as a potential resource that they may invest in an economic 
    activity. Exactly how much each member earns is also determined by (1) the amounts 
    of public goods (analogous to roads, bridges, public transit, and other government 
    services in the real world) that are funded by taxes paid by the participants, and 
    (2) the amount of tax that each individual pays. In general, you’ll earn more if 
    there are more public goods being funded by the tax payments of the group as a whole, 
    and you’ll earn more if the amount of tax that you personally pay is lower, since 
    paying more tax leaves you less to put into your own economic activity. 
  </p>

  <p>
    Once all participants have been informed of their initial wealth levels, the group 
    will collectively decide the tax level that will be binding for all participants. 
    Each person will vote for a tax rate that they would like to be applied to all 
    participants, themselves included. Once the votes are submitted, the median of all 
    submitted preferred tax rates will be determined and selected as the tax rate 
    applicable to the group. 
  </p>

  <h6>
    How is the median determined?
  </h6>

  <p>
    In the context of nine values, the median M is defined as the value such that 
    there are five numbers that are smaller than or equal to M; and there are five 
    numbers that are greater than or equal to M. For example, suppose you and your 
    friends must all choose an amount to contribute to pay for the food at a party. 
    You select $5, and the other eight participants of your group have chosen: $1, 
    $4, $8, $9, $10, $7, $8, $2. To find the median number, you can sort from low to 
    high as in the table below, then find the number in the middle position 
    (position 5). That is the median.

    The median in the example would be $6, which is the middle amount in a sorted 
    list. When you and other participants select a tax rate, the median amount will 
    be computed in this fashion.

    Messaging Before Selecting Group Tax Rate
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </h5>

  {% if msg_type == 'single' %}
    <p>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      After assignment of income each player will be given the chance to send a 
      message to any, some, or all other players. You will compose the message to 
      other participants a box like the one below, and use the checkboxes to select 
      the participants to whom you would like to send the message.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <img src="{% static 'Single_msg.PNG' %}"/>

    <p>
      For example, if you write “AAA” in the box, and check wealth 125 above, that means 
      that the participant with a wealth of 125 points will receive that message “AAA.”
      All messages are delivered after everyone has finished writing their messages. 
      Messages are unidirectional, which means there will be no opportunity for back 
      and forth communication. Please note that you may not send a message that contains 
      inappropriate language, that conveys a threat, or that tells the others your name 
      or other identifying information, but any other message is fine. 
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ll have to spend some of your wealth if you want to send a message. The total 
      amount of points spent on the messaging is equal to the total number of messages 
      you send times the cost per message of {{ message_cost }} points. This total cost 
      will be subtracted from the initial wealth.
    </p>

  {% elif msg_type == 'double' %}
    <p>
      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
      After assignment of income each player will be given the chance to send one or 
      two messages to any, some, or all other players. You will compose messages to 
      other participants in boxes like the ones below, and use the checkboxes to select 
      the participants to whom you would like to send the corresponding message.
      {% endblocktrans %}
    </p>
    
    <img src="{% static 'dual_msg.PNG' %}" />

    <p>
      For example, if you write “AAA” in box 1, and check wealth 125 above, that means 
      that the participant with a wealth of 125 points will receive that message “AAA.”
      All messages are delivered after everyone has finished writing their messages.

    Payoffs
    {% endblocktrans %}
  </h5>

  <p>
    The payoff for the round is calculated as follows. First, the total cost of the 
    messages you sent is subtracted from initial wealth. Then each member's initial 
    wealth is taxed at the chosen (median) tax rate. This generates two relevant values: 
    what is left after taxes (a private resource) and the total amount of tax revenue 
    (viewed as resources that fund public goods). 
  </p>

  <p>
    The payoff takes into consideration the resources that have been paid to the 
    government. In particular, we consider the direct benefit from public goods 
    (ex.: the benefit of social security, or unemployment insurance) and the indirect 
    benefit via positive effects of public goods on our own private productivity 
    (ex.: the benefit that companies receive from having roads and private property 
    rights). 
  </p>

  <p>
    To better understand how these payoffs work, please see the table 
    below that shows a player's potential payoff based on their initial wealth level 
    and tax rate.
